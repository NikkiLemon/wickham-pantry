<h2>Testing</h2>

Throughout making this website for The Wickham Pantry, I have come up with many obstacles that I have had to test and find new ways to kee my site looking its best and responsive. 

I have tested my site across a varied number of different site, sarafi, chrome etc and screen sizes, TV screens down to small mobile devices.

Some testing that I have had to do was to make sure that my heading section was not getting lost and covered by the main images on the page. When full screen this was correct but when going to smaller screens this wasn't working. I had to change some of the positioning of the carousel and the header for this to become fully responsive. Also when on smaller screens I decided to make the carousel scale down otherwise it was covering the majority of a mobile device screen. 

I have also made the smaller mobile screens center aligned as this appears to be more user friendly and visably pleasing. 

<h2>Validator Testing</h2>
<b>HTML</b>
<li>No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator</li>
<b>CSS</b>
<li>No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator</li>

<h2>Unfixed Bugs</h2>
<p>One unfixed bug woukd be the menu section on the site. I would like to be able to make this into a Hamburger menu when on smaller devices but it was not responsive to being in the top right corner and when opened was hidden under the carousel. For the moment the menu is resposive by going into a vertical list when on smaller mobile devices.</p>

<h2>Deployment</h2>
The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
